            <strong>Boil Lasagna Noodles:</strong>
            <p>    Fill a large pot with water, bring it to a boil, add a pinch of salt.
                Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente.
                Drain and lay the noodles flat on a sheet of aluminum foil or a clean cloth to prevent sticking.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare Meat Sauce:</strong>
            <p>    In a large skillet, heat some olive oil over medium heat.
                Add chopped onions and minced garlic; sauté until translucent.
                Add the ground beef or pork; cook until browned.
                Stir in canned tomatoes, tomato paste, salt, pepper, and dried herbs.
                Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Mix Cheese Filling:</strong>
            <p>In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese with an egg. Add grated mozzarella and Parmesan cheese, season with salt and pepper, and mix well.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Assemble Lasagna:</strong>
            <p>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce in the bottom of a baking dish.
                Place a layer of noodles over the sauce.
                Spread a layer of the cheese mixture over the noodles.
                Repeat the layers (sauce, noodles, cheese) until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of meat sauce.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Add Cheese Topping:</strong>
            <p>Sprinkle a generous layer of grated mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bake: </strong>
            <p>    Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes.
                Remove foil and bake for another 25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Rest:</strong>
            <p>Let the lasagna sit for about 10-15 minutes before cutting. This helps the layers set and makes it easier to serve.</p>
